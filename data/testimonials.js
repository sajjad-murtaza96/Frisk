    text: "XperLabs is amazing. They went above and beyond the original scope of the project to satisfy our business and technical requirements for a successful app launch. They in fact continue to support and work with my company to finish some technical mapping work that we are doing. They are more than capable of bringing about a successful app launch, and by the way, they should be charging a lot more for their services at this point so jump on it while you can. They have great react native skills with an understanding of both front and backend interactions within the app. I hope to continue to retain them through the app's launch and beyond to continue to make some modifications and enhancements over time.",

    text: "XperLabs brought my vision to life. I previously hired another freelancer and paid for a website that I ultimately had to just trash. I hired XperLabs and their site design and development has given me the confidence to launch this site knowing the positive reaction it will receive. My challenge to them at the beginning was that if I am not impressed with my own site I will not launch it. Well I am thoroughly impressed. What I appreciated most was that they have a combination of technical and creative skills and a personality that was a pleasure to work with. They are both confident and humble and accepted constructive feedback professionally and gracefully. Not only will I work with them again, I am hiring them to permanently maintain and update my site.",
